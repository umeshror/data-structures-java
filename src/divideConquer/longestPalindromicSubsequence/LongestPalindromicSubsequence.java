/*
* We are given a string ’S’
* We need to find the length of its Longest Palindromic Subsequence in the given ’S’ String
* A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements
* Palindrome is astinrg that reads the same backward as well as forward and can be of odd or even length

e.g. 1
Input: ‘ELRMENMET’
Output: 5
LPS is EMEME
