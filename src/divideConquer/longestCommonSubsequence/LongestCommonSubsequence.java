/*
* We are given 2 strings
* We need to find the length of the longest subsequence which is common in both the strings
* Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence buy deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements

e.g.  ABCDE is sequence
Sol: ADE, ACE, ACD, ABD, ABCE and ABDE are sequences
e.g.
S1: elephant
S2 eretpat

Output :5, The longest substring is â€œexpat"
